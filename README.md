Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software. In recent time, it has become one of the most used language amng developers espcially backend and cloud profesionals.
It is a statically typed, compiled language. In many languages, there are many ways to solve a given problem. Programmers can spend a lot of time thinking about the best way to solve it.
Go, on the other hand, believes in fewer features — with only one right way to solve the problem. Also, there are no “expressive” features like maps and filters in Go.

# Features 

Some interesting features of Go include the following:

* The built-in frameworks for testing and profiling are small and easy to learn, but still fully functional. There are plenty of third-party add-ons, but chances are you won’t need them.
* It’s possible to debug and profile an optimized binary running in production through an HTTP server.
* Go has automatically generated documentation with testable examples. Once again, the interface is minimal, and there is very little to learn.
* Go is strongly and statically typed with no implicit conversions, but the syntactic overhead is still surprisingly small. This is achieved by simple type inference in assign­ments together with untyped numeric constants. This gives Go stronger type safety than Java (which has implicit conversions), but the code reads more like Python (which has untyped variables).
* Programs are constructed from packages that offer clear code separation and allow efficient management of dependencies. The package mechanism is perhaps the single most well-designed feature of the language, and certainly one of the most overlooked.
* Structurally typed interfaces provide runtime polymorphism through dynamic dispatch.
* Concurrency is an integral part of Go, supported by goroutines, channels and the select statement.

After understanding how relevant the language is in the software engineering field today, it is expedient that we take on out cup of coffee and start typing some more code. This repository is to run you on step-by-step process on becoming a good Go programmer but remember there is trick to becoming good, you become good by writing more code everyday.

Double your interest in Go and switch on notification on this repository as I update it with awesome Go features at least every week. Cheers.

# Installing Go

* Just go to the [official website](https://golang.org/dl/ and download any version that corresponds with your local machine.

## MacOS
* Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

* Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
      ``` go version```
* Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.

## Windows
* Open the MSI file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

* Verify that you've installed Go. In the Command Prompt window that appears, type the following command:
      ```go version```
* Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.

## Linux
* Download the archive and extract it into /usr/local, creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. Run the following as root or through sudo:
      ```tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.15.7.linux-amd64.tar.gz```
* Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.
* You can do this by adding the following line to your ```$HOME/.profile or /etc/profile ```
 (for a system-wide installation): ```export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin```

* Note: Changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile using a command such as source ```$HOME/.profile.```

* Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
      ```$ go version```
* Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
